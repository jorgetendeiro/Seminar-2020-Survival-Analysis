This workshop takes place online in room *xxx* from 9:30 to 14:15 on April, xx, 2020.

I aim at offering a gentle introduction to survival analysis. I will mostly do intro stuff from the book. showcase and what not.

All code is freely available from [Github](https://github.com/jorgetendeiro/Seminar-2020-Survival-Analysis). The slides are available [here](slides/Presentation.pdf).

All analyses are fully reproducible. I will use [R](https://www.r-project.org) (with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) as the graphical user interface). The following R packages will be used and should be installed in case you want to mimic the analyses shown on the slides:

  - `rstan` : R interface for [Stan](https://mc-stan.org).
  - `bayesplot`: To render plots, fully integrated with Stan.
