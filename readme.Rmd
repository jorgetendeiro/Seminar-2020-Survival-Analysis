This one-hour talk takes place online at 11:00 on May 07, 2020.

I aim at offering a gentle introduction to survival analysis. I mostly present introductory material, which is strongly inspired by Frank Harrell's book "Regression Modeling Strategies".

All code is freely available from [Github](https://github.com/jorgetendeiro/Seminar-2020-Survival-Analysis). The slides are available [here](slides/Presentation.pdf).
